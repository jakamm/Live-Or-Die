  - "\r\nPleasant Greetings,\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is your one and only game master with
    a message for you. There is no point to try and hide, because we are always watching.\r\n\r\nPlay
    by the rules and you will survive, but watch out! Around every corner there just
    might be one of my hounds ready to pounce! \r\n\r\nContinue on to find more breadcrumbs
    I have laid out for you. Though there are only two outcomes for you tonight.\r\n\r\n\r\nLive
    or DIE!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n-The Game Master\r\n"
  - "Another locked door, but where is the key?\r\nYour freedom is hanging in the
    balance.\r"
  - "These two ended up killing each other over the first digit.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    simple. \r\nPlants = #1.\r"
  - "You\u2019ve found where we store the bodies.\r\nWe have electronically locked
    this door.\r"
  - "I will keep this one simple for you.\r\nThe combination to this locked box is
    at the end of a video tape.\r"
  - "Fredward G. Peabody,\r\n\r\nYou are out of options here Fredward. If you let
    1 more contestant through your sector, then I will terminate you myself.\r\n\r\nI
    am tired of hearing 3 different excuses from Minerva when I ask how this has
    happened. It\u2019s either you or her who is the 1 slipping up, but her numbers
    don\u2019t lie.\r\n\r\nIn the end, she gets results, you do not. It is an obvious
    decision on my part that will probably secure me a promotion. Get your shit together
    or sector 2 is getting a new Game Master. \r\n\r\nNo more chances,\r\nJimothy\r\n"
  - "Manager#6018,\r\n\r\nWe are reaching out to you to inform you of our new serum.
    We call it the Morien Serum, after Dr. Rebecca Morien herself. This is strictly
    to be used when one of the contestants make it through the whole game. \r\n\r\nUnder
    no circumstance should you ever let a contestant make it out of your sector.
    If they should reach the core, then I wouldn\u2019t even want to think about
    what they could do to our operation.\r\n\r\nRemember loose lips sink ships,\r\n\r\nDr.
    Jimothy Marsters\r\nDirector of Snuff Productions"
  - "Freddy,\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t keep covering for you with management. This is the
    5th time I had to clean up one of your messes. The Director even chewed me out
    for how my part of the operation is going. I have only had 2 contestants make
    it to the halfway marker this past month!\r\n\r\nIf I have to, then I will send
    Marsters your way. I don\u2019t want to do it Freddy, but I have 6 more months
    until I get promoted. I know you will understand 1 day.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry,\r\n\r\nMinerva"
